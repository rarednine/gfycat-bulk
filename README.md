# GfycatBulk

If you use [Gfycat](http://www.gfycat.com/) to make your GIFs jiffier, uploading each GIF you have one at a time may not be very convenient.

Use GfycatBulk to batch upload your GIFs and download your converted MP4s automatically.

## Requirements

This version was tested on Python v2.7.5

* Uses the requests library, so you'll need to install that if you haven't already. It's totally worth having anyway.

## Modifications

If you have a better way to do anything, feel free to send a pull request.
