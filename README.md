# GfycatBulk

If you use [Gfycat](http://www.gfycat.com/) to make your GIFs jiffier, uploading each GIF you have one at a time is neither convenient nor practical.

Use GfycatBulk to batch upload your GIFs and download your converted MP4s automatically.

## Requirements

This version was tested on Python 2.7.5

It uses the requests library, so you'll need to install that if you haven't already. It's totally worth having anyway.

## Usage

Place the GIFs in a folder named GIF, and create a folder named MP4. When you run the script, the newly converted MP4s will be saved to the MP4 folder.
